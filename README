Example echo server application.

Run make inside the folder and execute the binary as shown below.

	$ cd <source-dir>
	$ make
	$ ./echo-server [--echo] [--ip <ip-address>] [port]

	'--echo' => echo to local stdout (on the server side)
	'--ip <ip-address>' => IP address to listen on. Default is INADDR_ANY
	'port' => port to listen on. Default is 8001

Limitations:
    - Works with IPv4 addresses only
    - No daemon mode. Runs only in foreground
    - Only for quick testing server reachability

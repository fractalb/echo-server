Example echo server application.

Run make inside the folder and execute the binary as shown below.

	$ cd <source-dir>
	$ make
	$ ./echo-server [-e] [-ip xxx] [xxx]

	'-e' => echo locally (on the server side)
	'-ip x.y.z.w' => IP address. Default is INADDR_ANY
	'xxx' => port to listen on. Default is 8001

Limitations:
    - can handle only a single connection.
    - Works with IPv4 addresses only
